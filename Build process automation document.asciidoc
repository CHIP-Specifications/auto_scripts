*After flashing new ubuntu image on pi below steps to follow to run
automated build*

*We need to establish connection between Linux image and git hub actions
in order to clone GitHub repos to Linux machine we use ssh password less
authentication*

*To enable ssh password less authentication we need to following steps:*

*1.To generate a new SSH key pair, run the following command
(replace your_email@example.com with your email address):*

*ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C “your_email@example.com”*

**Press **Enter* to accept the default location.*

*2.Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:*

*ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa*

*3.Start by copying your public SSH key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) file
contents*

== 

== *GitHub*

*Using a browser, go to the GitHub home page
at https://github.com/[github.com] and sign in to your account.*

**In the upper-right corner of the page, click your profile photo, then
click **Settings*:*

image:media/image1.jpeg[image,width=601,height=217]

**In the user settings sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**. Then
click **New SSH key**.**

**Fill in the **Title** field with a descriptive label for the new key
(for example, the name of your computer) and paste your public key into
the **Key** field. Finally, click **Add SSH key**:**

image:media/image2.jpeg[image,width=601,height=409]

Now the key appears in the list of SSH keys associated with your
account:

image:media/image3.jpeg[image,width=601,height=205]

*Once Above steps are executed successfully, clone below repo for
automated scripts*

*Git clone git@github.com:Srinivasan-78/auto_scripts.git*

*Go to /home/ubuntu/auto scripts folder and run bash ./autostart.sh
file*

*Autostart.sh file executes multiple scripts in below model as part of
build*

FILE=/home/ubuntu/flag.txt

if test -f "$FILE"; then

bash ./docker_perms.sh &&

sudo bash ./docker_Setup.sh &&

bash ./building_Apps.sh

rm flag.txt

bash ./remove_scripts.sh

bash ./dd.sh v_latest

else

bash ./move_to_root.sh *Moves all files from auto_scripts folder to
/home/ubuntu*

cd /home/ubuntu

sudo bash ./kernal_patch.sh *System goes for reboot post reboot need to
re-start script*

sudo bash ./dependencies.sh

bash ./test_harness.sh &&

bash ./connectedhomeip.sh &&

sudo bash ./config.sh

touch flag.txt

sudo reboot *System goes for reboot post reboot need to re-start script*

fi

Note: we require restart auto_start.sh file from /home/ubuntu folder
since we are moving all files to /home/ubuntu location
